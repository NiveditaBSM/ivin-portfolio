This is the very first version of my portfolio, and I am super excited to share this!

The portfolio showcases a glimse of who I am professionally, my work and brief about some of the projects that I've worked on. Feel free to check out the portfolio and say hello if you find anything of your interest (or you can say hello anyways)

Special thanks to @ajlkn for amazing Hyperspace template at HTML5 UP. I've customized the styling and elements of the template to build it into my own portfolio compatible across devices.
